# Trello Clone with React!

As a recent Web Dev student, I've dedicated the last few weeks to study ReactJS. As a Trello user, I thought that create a Trello clone must be a fun way to practice the use of this tool.

I hope you enjoy it! :)

### What is this project?
A Trello application clone - a software very useful to manage projects and colaborate with people -, designed with React. The goal is not to just copy the Trello interface, but change some of it's features and create "my Trello version". 

### What does this project looks like?
Here goes a loom video about the application inteface:

### What was my motivation?
When I was starting the studies on ReactJS, I was thinking about some "not so obvious" uses for this tool. So I thought that Trello should be a nice application to "clone" with React.

### Why did I build this project?
To start to practice React with a "real" project. This is my "Hello world" on ReactJS.

### What problem does it solve?
If you use Trello and have problems with it, Trellact may be your solution! Despite it is a Trello inspired application, there are some differences between Trello and Trellact.

### What did I learn?
I learned how to use ReactJS to create an application with components. I think that, if I tried to code this application with Vanilla JS, probably I should write a lot of unecessary lines of code.

### Future plans
I have a lot of bugs to fix and new features to work on. The details are onn the Issues page, but the main goal is to create the full interface of Trello - not just a board, as now -, allowing the user to interact with all of the boards.
