# Trello Clone with React!

As a recent Web Dev student, I've dedicated the last few weeks to study ReactJS. To put all of these new knowledge into practice, I'm working on a Trello application clone - a software very useful to manage projects and colaborate with people -, designed with React. The road to the final version may be long for a newby, so I accept suggestions and criticism about the project. 

At the end of the project, I intend to:
- Have a complete iteration among the boards, created by the user;
- Create a search engine that allow the user to find cards by name or tag;

I hope you enjoy! :)
